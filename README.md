# Face Detection

This code builds a Face Detection model using a Convolution Neural Network, where the model was trained to learn the patterns using multiple datasets and tested on a separate dataset consisting of four different demographics which were dark-skinned and light-skinned of both genders to see whether the model was biased or not.

Training Data:

Positive training data: CelebA Dataset. A large-scale (over 200K images) of celebrity faces.

Negative training data: ImageNet. Many images across many different categories. We'll take negative examples from a variety of non-human categories.

Test Data: 

Pilot Parliaments Benchmark (PPB). The PPB dataset consists of images of 1270 male and female parliamentarians from various African and European countries and exhibits parity in both skin tone and gender.
